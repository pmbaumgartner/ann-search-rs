**Fixes**

- Nasty branch bug in wgpu <> metal interaction that made the NNDescent
  iterations for the CAGRA-style ANN search not work.

**Features**

- Accessor in the Tensor implementation for the handle within the crate for
  easier sharing across crates.

## 0.4.1

**Features**

- Faster convergence criterium for k-means iterations.

**Fixes**

- Collapse of performance of the GPU indices when reaching higher
  dimensionalities with `SharedMemory::new()`.

## 0.4.0

**Features**

- Version bump on cubecl to `"0.10.0"`. This might introduce *breaking* changes
  if you are using the package with older versions of cubecl.

- Better benchmarking with an cell embedding-like benchmark.
- Better entry seeds for the CAGRA style graph.

**Fixes**

- Nasty SIMD overflow bug hitting RaBitQ at higher dimensionalities.

## 0.3.1

**Fix**

- The GPU indices would throw errors due to a bug with the wrong dimensionality
  being checked.

## 0.3.0

Large update with breaking changes!

**Features**

- Manhattan distance enabled on some indices
- More fine control over k-means parameters
- Canberra distance implemented for the SimdDistance trait
  - Renamed of `Euclidean` to `SquaredEuclidean` to be more explicit

## 0.2.10

**Features**

- Making some other functions public in the k-means part supporting IVF for
  easier re-use in other crates.

## 0.2.9

**Features**

## 0.2.5

**Yanked**

Aggressive performance optimisations for various CPU-based indices, removed a
nasty memory corruption bug from the exhaustive GPU search. Reordering of the
module structure to clean up the library.

**Features:**

- Improved Annoy with better memory layout for faster querying.
- Better documentation (more Rust idiomatic), plus correction of copy and paste
  errors.
